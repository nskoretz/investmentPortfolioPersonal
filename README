GENERAL PROBLEM
The assignment specified that we make a working GUI for our Portfolio project,
which we have been working on since the beginning of the semester.




ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
    There is an assumption that when adding to an existing investment, if the
user matches the symbol but does not match the name, the program will continue
anyways with just the symbols matching. As the symbols are unique.

    It was assumed that the GUI did not need to look exactly like the
mockups in the spec. As there was only one line that weakly said "Create an
initial interface that looks like the first figure at the end of this
description". All components are there and all the functionality works. I used
GridBagLayout.

I saw on the discussion boards that this project didn't need to save to a
file. Mine does, but its a hardcoded path. The program saves and loads to
"SavedInvestments.txt'




BUILD AND TEST (USER GUIDE)
Unpack the 'nskoretz_a3.tar.gz' and navigate inside to the 'a3' folder.
Run 'javac *.java'
Navigate up one directory.
Run 'java a3.Portfolio'




TEST PLAN
For buying an investment ( stock or mutual fund ) I test each input to make
sure it is of the right type, I prompt the user again if otherwise.

To search, my function must cover cases where no symbol, keywords or range is
input. It also must cover if only symbol is input, keywords are input, and
only range is input. It must also cover all combinations of those inputs as
well. As well as, a potentially large amount of keywords. It must also handle
price range inputs such as
-40
40-
40-50
40.2
